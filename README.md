Yeah yeah yeah, I know that styles are ugly and implementation is not that good as it should, but anyway - it works well (but slow because of data amount). Will do style fixes (responsive + proper theme colors) on weekend. If you want to launch - `npm i` and `npm run start`, in case you didn't know it after all the test cases that you checked xD.
